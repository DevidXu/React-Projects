This is a project inspired by sample APP on React official website. Here is the link to the [original site](https://github.com/DevidXu/React/tree/master/Compare). Here I rewrote it with React template without Redux since I haven't learnt it. The benefit is that it makes the whole project looks easier to guys new to React. Hope it can help!

Before running the sample, please ensure you have installed [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer.
The process contains only 3 steps:

1. run the command: npx create-react-app compare

2. Copy the files in this repository into "compare" directory. Overwrite all of them!

3. Run the command in "compare" directory: npm start

Then you can take the enjoyment!
